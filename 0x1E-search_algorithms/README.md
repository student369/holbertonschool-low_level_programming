# Search Algorithms

Project to understand some search algorithms in C

This project contain the following files:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-linear.c | A C function that use linear search. |
| 1-binary.c | A C function that use binary search. |
| 2-O | The worst case of time complexity in a linear search. |
| 3-O | The worst case of space complexity in a linear search. |
| 4-O | The worst case of time complexity in a binary search. |
| 5-O | The worst case of space complexity in a binary search. |
| 6-O | The space complexity of the function. |
