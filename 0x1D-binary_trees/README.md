# Binary trees

A project to understand the concept of the Binary trees, mandatory to Holberton School.

This project contains the followed files:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-binary_tree_node.c | A function that create a tree node. |
| 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c | A function to insert a node in the left child of a given node. |
| 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c | A function to insert a node in the right child of a given node. |
| 3-binary_tree_delete.c | A function that delete the entire binary tree. |
| 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c | A function that checks if a node is a leaf. |
| 5-binary_tree_is_root.c | A function that checks if the node it's a root. |
| 6-binary_tree_preorder.c | A function that throudg a binary tree in pre-order traversal. |
| 7-binary_tree_inorder.c | A function that throudg a binary tree in in-order traversal. |
| 8-binary_tree_postorder.c | A function that throudg a binary tree in post-order traversal |
| 9-binary_tree_height.c | A function that measure the height of the binary tree. |
| 10-binary_tree_depth.c | A function that mesaure the depth of a node in the binary tree. |
| 11-binary_tree_size.c | A function that mesaure the size of the binary tree. |
| 12-binary_tree_leaves.c | A function that counts the leaves in a binary tree. |
| 13-binary_tree_nodes.c | A function that coints the nodes with one child of the binary tree. |
| 14-binary_tree_balance.c | A function that measure the balance factor of a binary tree. |
| 15-binary_tree_is_full.c | A function that checks if the binary tree is full. |
| 16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c | A function that checks if the binary is complete. |
| 17-binary_tree_sibling.c | A function that find the sibling of the node. |
| 18-binary_tree_uncle.c | A function that find the sibling of the parent node. |
